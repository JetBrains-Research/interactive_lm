      "0: To add an alias (CNAME) resource record to a zone. Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016. You can use this procedure to add an Alias canonical name (CNAME) resource record for your Web server to a zone in DNS on your domain controller. With CNAME records, you can use more than one name to point to a single host, making it easy to do such things as host both a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and a Web server on the same computer \n",
      "1: A hostname defined in a CNAME record must have no other resource records of other types (MX, A, etc.), except for DNSSEC records like RRSIG and NSEC. CNAME records can point to other CNAME records, but this is not considered a good practice as it is inefficient. MX and NS records must never point to a CNAME alias. Domains that are used for e-mail may not have a CNAME record - this can have undesirable results with different mail servers. CNAMEs and Alternative Record Types \n",
      "2: A CNAME record is a standard DNS resource record supported by all RFC compliant DNS servers. CNAME is an abbreviation for Canonical Name record, and it is essentially an alias for another domain. All information, such as IP Addresses, TTL, etc., are defined by the FQDN (fully qualified domain name) it points to \n",
      "3: A CNAME record stands for Canonical Name. This record specifies merely an alias or nickname of a primary host. For instance, if you have a domain name like example.com, but you want users to access it using its www part (www.example.com), you can create a CNAME record pointing to the example.com site \n",
      "4: A CNAME, or Canonical Name record, is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. For example, say you have several subdomains, like www.mydomain.com, ftp.mydomain.com, mail.mydomain.com etc and you want these sub domains to point to your main domain name mydomain.com \n",
